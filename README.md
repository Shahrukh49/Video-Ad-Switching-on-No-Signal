# Video-Ad-Switching-on-No-Signal

Project is made for a news channel. It contains Raspberry Pi as its main component. The idea is that, whenever the signal of Receiver disconnects from the transmitter, the HDMI should switch and play a Video Ad that is saved inside a USB or SD Card connected to the Raspberry Pi. This way the audience will get uninterrupted footage from the TV Channel on their screens without even knowing that the transmitter has stopped working. 

Project works on rtmp for streaming data and http for checking if tranmitter is up and running.
